## Lab - Week 2

# Sum of Squares

### Assignment:
Update file sum_sq.c to:
1. Accept two integers, eg: x=2, y=3
2. Compute the square of integers - using math.h library functions: x^2 , y^2
3. Print the sum of the squares of the integers: x^2 + y^2

### Steps to submit changes:
1. Click on sum_sq.c to open file
2. Click the pencil icon to edit file on the top right
3. Update the file with code following assignment instructions
4. Once you are ready to submit your changes, click on the green "Commit changes..." button on the top right
5. Enter a commit message that describes your changes in a few words - eg: added printf statement
6. Select "Commit directly to the main branch"
7. Click on "Commit Changes" button. Your code changes have been submitted!

### To check whether your code changes passed:
1. Click on "Pull Requests" on the top
2. Click on "Feedback" to open Feedback page
3. If you last code change passed, you will see a green check mark against your commit message. If it did not pass, you will see a red cross.

### To investigate how your code performed:
1. On the Feedback page, click on "Show all checks" on the bottom right. You can skip this step if you see "Hide all checks"
2. Click on "Details"
3. Expand the desired section. If your code did not pass, you will expand "Run education/autograding@v1" and see the error message.

### Note:
We strongly recommend you run your finished programs on your local machine/laptop first to test if they are working correctly. You should always test on your laptop first, and then copy the finished code to github.

If your code did not pass, revise your code and submit(commit) your changes again.

Make sure you have your final submission in before the deadline has passed.

You will not be able to submit changes after the deadline has passed.
